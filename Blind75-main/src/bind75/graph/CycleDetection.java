//Iterate over all the nodes of the graph and Keep a visited array visited[] to track the visited nodes.
//        Run a Depth First Traversal on the given subgraph connected to the current node and pass the parent of the current node. In each recursive
//        Set visited[root] as 1.
//        Iterate over all adjacent nodes of the current node in the adjacency list
//        If it is not visited then run DFS on that node and return true if it returns true.
//        Else if the adjacent node is visited and not the parent of the current node then return true.
//        Return false.
